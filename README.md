# MS Project

These are the results of my work fulfilling the research project requirement for an MS degree in statistics at Oregon State University.

I investigated two aspects of **SPIEC-EASI** (**SP**arse **I**nvers**E** **C**ovariance **E**stimation for **E**cological **AS**sociation **I**nference), a method proposed by Kurtz et al. (2015) for inferring a network of microbial relationships in a particular environment based on 16S amplicon sequencing data. First, I investigated  some covariance properties and relationships which underly a key assumption of SPIEC-EASI. Second, I used simulations to assess the performance of SPIEC-EASI under ideal conditions and under problematic conditions.

I submitted papers and made presentations about these results for both my master's research project and for the student paper competition of the International Biometric Society WNAR 2017 conference. See `papers` and `presentations`.

In 2019, did some more work trying to understand what basis correlations and partial correlations are possible for a given compositional dataset but decided there weren't any findings worth trying to publish.
